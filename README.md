# When2Meet Filler
This is a simple brower-based extension that automatically fills in when2meet.com using an ical file.

## Features
- Works with recurring events
- Automatically converts the timezone of events to the local timezone
- Works with both dates and days of the week in when2meet

## Limitations (to Fix)
- Only works with contiguous dates (i.e. the dates in when2meet must all follow eachother)
